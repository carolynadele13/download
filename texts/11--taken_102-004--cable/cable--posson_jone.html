    <h4>George Washington Cable.<br>
      "Posson Jone'."</h4>
    <p>To Jules St.-Ange&#8212;elegant little heathen&#8212;there yet remained at
      manhood a remembrance of having been to school, and of having been
      taught by a stony-headed <span id="CpossonF01"></span><a
        href="#CpossonN01">Capuchin</a> that the world is round&#8212;for
      example, like a cheese. This round world is a cheese to be eaten
      through, and Jules had nibbled quite into his cheese-world already
      at twenty-two.<br>
    </p>
    <p>He realized this as he idled about one Sunday morning where the
      intersection of Royal and Conti Streets some seventy years ago
      formed a central corner of New Orleans. Yes, yes, the trouble was
      he had been wasteful and honest. He discussed the matter with that
      faithful friend and confidant, Baptiste, his yellow body-servant.
      They concluded that, papa's patience and <span style="font-style:
        italic;" id="CpossonF02"></span><a style="font-style: italic;"
        href="#CpossonN02">tante's</a> pin-money having been gnawed away
      quite to the rind, there were left open only these few
      easily-enumerated resorts: to go to work&#8212;they shuddered; to join
      Major Innerarity's <span id="CpossonF03"></span><a
        href="#CpossonN03">filibustering expedition</a>; or else&#8212;why
      not?&#8212;to try some games of confidence. At twenty-two one must begin
      to be something. Nothing else tempted; could that avail? One could
      but try. It is noble to try; and, besides, they were hungry. If
      one could "make the friendship" of some person from the country,
      for instance, with money, not expert at cards or dice, but, as one
      would say, willing to learn, one might find cause to say some
      "Hail Marys."</p>
    <p>The sun broke through a clearing sky, and Baptiste pronounced it
      good for luck. There had been a hurricane in the night. The
      weed-grown tile-roofs were still dripping, and from lofty brick
      and low adobe walls a rising steam responded to the summer
      sunlight. Up-street, and across the Rue du Canal, one could get
      glimpses of the gardens in <span id="CpossonF04"></span><a
        href="#CpossonN04">Faubourg Ste.-Marie</a> standing in silent
      wretchedness, so many tearful Lucretias, tattered victims of the
      storm. Short remnants of the wind now and then came down the
      narrow street in erratic puffs heavily laden with odors of broken
      boughs and torn flowers, skimmed the little pools of rain-water in
      the deep ruts of the unpaved street, and suddenly went away to
      nothing, like a juggler's butterflies or a young man's money.</p>
    <p>It was very picturesque, the Rue Royale. The rich and poor met
      together. The locksmith's swinging key creaked next door to the
      bank; across the way, crouching, mendicant-like, in the shadow of
      a great importing-house, was the mud laboratory of the mender of
      broken combs. Light balconies overhung the rows of showy shops and
      stores open for trade this Sunday morning, and pretty Latin faces
      of the higher class glanced over their savagely-pronged railings
      upon the passers below. At some windows hung lace certains,
      flannel duds at some, and at others only the scraping and sighing
      one-hinged shutter groaning toward Paris after its neglectful
      master.</p>
    <p>M. St.-Ange stood looking up and down the street for nearly an
      hour. But few ladies, only the inveterate mass-goers, were out.
      About the entrance of the frequent <i>caf&eacute;s</i> the
      masculine gentility stood leaning on canes, with which now one and
      now another beckoned to Jules, some even adding pantomimic hints
      of the social cup.</p>
    <p>M. St.-Ange remarked to his servant without turning his head that
      somehow he felt sure he should soon return those <span
        id="CpossonF05"></span><a style="font-style: italic;"
        class="sgc-1" href="#CpossonN05">bons</a> that the mulatto had
      lent him.</p>
    <p class="sgc-1">"What will you do with them?"</p>
    <p>"Me!" said Baptiste, quickly; "I will go and see the bull-fight
      in the <span id="CpossonF06"></span><a class="sgc-1"
        href="#CpossonN06">Place Congo</a>."</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>"There is to be a bull-fight? But where is <span id="CpossonF07"></span>
<a href="#CpossonN07">M. Cayetano</a>?"</p>
    <p>"Ah, got all his affairs wet in the tornado. Instead of his
      circus, they are to have a bull-fight&#8212;not an ordinary bull-fight
      with sick horses, but a buffalo-and-tiger fight. I would not miss
      it&#8212;"</p>
    <p>Two or three persons ran to the opposite corner, and commenced
      striking at something with their canes. Others followed. Can M.
      St.-Ange and servant, who hasten forward&#8212;can the Creoles, Cubans,
      Spaniards, San Domingo refugees, and other loungers&#8212;can they hope
      it is a fight? They hurry forward. Is a man in a fit? The crowd
      pours in from the side-streets. Have they killed a so-long snake?
      Bareheaded shopmen leave their wives, who stand upon chairs. The
      crowd huddles and packs. Those on the outside make little leaps
      into the air, trying to be tall.</p>
    <p>"What is the matter?"</p>
    <p>"Have they caught a real live rat?"</p>
    <p>"Who is hurt?" asks some one in English.</p>
    <p>"<span id="CpossonF08"></span><a href="#CpossonN08"><i>Personne</i></a>,"
replies a shopkeeper; "a man's hat blow' in the
      gutter; but he has it now. Jules pick' it. See, that is the man,
      head and shoulders on top the res'."</p>
    <p>"He in the <span id="CpossonF09"></span><a href="#CpossonN09">homespun</a>?" asks a second shopkeeper. "Humph! an <i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>&#8212;a
<span id="CpossonF10"></span><a href="#CpossonN10">West-Floridian</a>; bah!"</p>
    <p>"But wait; 'st! he is speaking; listen!"</p>
    <p>"To who is he speak&#8212;&#8212;?"</p>
    <p>"Sh-sh-sh! to Jules."</p>
    <p>"Jules who?"</p>
    <p>"Silence, you! To Jules St.-Ange, what h-owe me a bill since long
      time. Sh-sh-sh!"</p>
    <p>Then the voice was heard.</p>
    <p>Its owner was a man of giant stature, with a slight stoop in his
      shoulders, as if he was making a constant, good-natured attempt to
      accommodate himself to ordinary doors and ceilings. His bones were
      those of an ox. His face was marked more by weather than age, and
      his narrow brow was bald and smooth. He had instantaneously formed
      an opinion of Jules St.-Ange, and the multitude of words, most of
      them lingual curiosities, with which he was rasping the wide-open
      ears of his listeners, signified, in short, that, as sure as his
      name was Parson Jones, the little Creole was a "plumb gentleman."</p>
    <p>M. St.-Ange bowed and smiled, and was about to call attention, by
      both gesture and speech, to a singular object on top of the still
      uncovered head, when the nervous motion of the <i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>
      anticipated him, as, throwing up an immense hand, he drew down a
      large roll of bank-notes. The crowd laughed, the West-Floridian
      joining, and began to disperse.</p>
    <p>"Why, that money belongs to Smyrny Church," said the giant.</p>
    <p>"You are very dengerous to make your money expose like that,
      Misty Posson Jone'," said St.-Ange, counting it with his eyes.</p>
    <p>The countryman gave a start and smile of surprise.</p>
    <p>"How d'd you know my name was Jones?" he asked; but, without
      pausing for the Creole's answer, furnished in his reckless way
      some further specimens of West-Floridian English; and the
      conciseness with which he presented full intelligence of his home,
      family, calling, lodging-house, and present and future plans,
      might have passed for consummate art, had it not been the most
      run-wild nature. "And I've done been to Mobile, you know, on busi<i>ness</i>
      for Bethesdy Church. It's the on'yest time I ever been from home;
      now you wouldn't of believed that, would you? But I admire to have
      saw you, that's so. You've got to come and eat with me. Me and my
      boy ain't been fed yit. What might one call yo' name? Jools? Come
      on, Jools. Come on, Colossus. That's my niggah&#8212;his name's Colossus
      of Rhodes. Is that yo' yallah boy, Jools? Fetch him along,
      Colossus. It seems like a special provi<i>dence</i>.&#8212;Jools, do you
      believe in a special provi<i>dence?</i>"</p>
    <p>Jules remembered the roll of bank-notes and said he did.</p>
    <p>The new-made friends moved briskly off, followed by Baptiste and
      a short, square, old negro, very black and grotesque, who had
      introduced himself to the mulatto, with many glittering and
      cavernous smiles, as "d'body-sarvant of d'Rev'n' Mr. Jones."</p>
    <p>Both pairs enlivened their walk with conversation. Parson Jones
      descanted upon the doctrine he had mentioned, as illustrated in
      the perplexities of cotton-growing, and concluded that there would
      always be "a special provi<i>dence</i> again' cotton untell folks
      quits a-pressin' of it and haulin' of it on Sundays!"</p>
    <p>"
<span id="CpossonF11"></span><a href="#CpossonN11"><i>Je dis</i></a>," 
said St.-Ange,
      in response, "I thing you is juz right. I believe, me,
      strong-strong in the improvidence, yes. You know my papa he h-own
      a sugah-plantation, you know. 'Jules, me son,' he say one time to
      me, 'I goin' to make one baril sugah to fedge the moze high price
      in New Orleans.' Well, he take his bez baril sugah&#8212;I nevah see a
      so careful man like me papa always to make a so beautiful sugah 
<span id="CpossonF12"></span><a href="#CpossonN11"><i>et  sirop</i></a>.  
'Jules, go at Father Pierre an' ged this lill pitcher
      fill with holy water, an' tell him sen' his tin bucket, and I will
      make it fill with 
<span id="CpossonF13"></span><a href="#CpossonN13"><i>quitte</i></a>.'  I ged the holy-water; my papa
      sprinkle it over the baril, an' make one cross on the 'ead of the
      baril."</p>
    <p>"Why, Jools," said Parson Jones, "that didn't do no good."</p>
    <p>"Din do no good! Id broughd the so great value! You can strike me
      dead if thad baril sugah din fedge the more high cost than any
      other in the city. 
<span id="CpossonF14"></span><a href="#CpossonN14"><i>Parceque</i></a>,
      the man what buy that baril sugah he make a mistake of one hundred
      pound"&#8212;falling back&#8212;"<span id="CpossonF15"></span><a href="#CpossonN15"><i>Mais</i></a> certainlee!"</p>
    <p>"And you think that was growin' out of the holy-water?" asked the
      parson.</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais</i>, what could make it else? Id could not be the <i>quitte</i>,
      because my papa keep the bucket, an' forget to sen' the <i>quitte</i>
      to Father Pierre."</p>
    <p>Parson Jones was disappointed.</p>
    <p>"Well, now, Jools, you know, I don't think that was right. I
      reckon you must be a plumb Catholic."</p>
    <p>M. St.-Ange shrugged. He would not deny his faith.</p>
    <p>"I am a <i>Catholique, mais</i>"&#8212;brightening as he hoped to
      recommend himself anew&#8212;"not a good one."</p>
    <p>"Well, you know," said Jones&#8212;"where's Colossus? Oh! all right.
      Colossus strayed off a minute in Mobile, and I plumb lost him for
      two days. Here's the place; come in. Colossus and this boy can go
      to the kitchen.&#8212;Now, Colossus, what <i>air</i> you a-beckonin' at
      me faw?"</p>
    <p>He let his servant draw him aside and address him in a whisper.</p>
    <p>"Oh, go 'way!" said the parson with a jerk. "Who's goin' to throw
      me? What? Speak louder. Why, Colossus, you shayn't talk so, saw.
      'Pon my soul, you're the mightiest fool I ever taken up with. Jest
      you go down that alley-way with this yalla boy, and don't show yo'
      face untell yo' called!"</p>
    <p>The negro begged; the master wrathily insisted.</p>
    <p>"Colossus, will you do ez I tell you, or shell I hev' to strike
      you, saw?"</p>
    <p>"O Mahs Jimmy, I&#8212;I's gwine; but"&#8212;he ventured nearer&#8212;"don't on no
      account drink nothin', Mahs Jimmy."</p>
    <p>Such was the negro's earnestness that he put one foot in the
      gutter, and fell heavily against his master. The parson threw him
      off angrily.</p>
    <p>"Thar, now! Why, Colossus, you most of been dosted with sumthin';
      yo' plumb crazy.&#8212;Humph, come on, Jools, let's eat! Humph! to tell
      me that when I never taken a drop, exceptin' for chills, in my
      life&#8212;which he knows so as well as me!"</p>
    <p>The two masters began to ascend a stair.</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais</i>, he is a sassy; I would sell him, me," said the
      young Creole.</p>
    <p>"No, I wouldn't do that," replied the parson; "though there is
      people in Bethesdy who says he is a rascal. He's a powerful smart
      fool. Why, that boy's got money, Jools; more money than religion,
      I reckon. I'm shore he fallen into mighty bad company"&#8212;they passed
      beyond earshot.</p>
    <p>Baptiste and Colossus, instead of going to the tavern kitchen,
      passed to the next door and entered the dark rear corner of a low
      grocery, where, the law notwithstanding, liquor was covertly sold
      to slaves. There, in the quiet company of Baptiste and the grocer,
      the colloquial powers of Colossus, which were simply prodigious,
      began very soon to show themselves.</p>
    <p>"For whilst," said he, "Mahs Jimmy has eddication, you
      know&#8212;whilst he has eddication, I has <span id="CpossonF16"></span><a href="#CpossonN16">'scretion</a>. He has eddication
      and I has 'scretion, an' so we gits along."</p>
    <p>He drew a black bottle down the counter, and, laying half his
      length upon the damp board, continued:</p>
    <p>"As a p'inciple I discredits de imbimin' of awjus liquors. De
      imbimin' of awjus liquors, de wiolution of de Sabbaf, de playin'
      of de fiddle, and de usin' of by-words, dey is de fo' sins of de
      conscience; an' if any man sin de fo' sins of de conscience, de
      debble done sharp his fork fo' dat man.&#8212;Ain't that so, boss?"</p>
    <p>The grocer was sure it was so.</p>
    <p>"Neberdeless, mind you"&#8212;here the orator brimmed his glass from
      the bottle and swallowed the contents with a dry eye&#8212;"mind you, a
      roytious man, sech as ministers of de gospel and dere
      body-sarvants, can take a <i>leetle</i> for de <span id="CpossonF17"></span><a href="#CpossonN17">weak stomach</a>."</p>
    <p>But the fascinations of Colossus's eloquence must not mislead us;
      this is the story of a true Christian; to wit, Parson Jones.</p>
    <p>The parson and his new friend ate. But the coffee M. St.-Ange
      declared he could not touch; it was too wretchedly bad. At the
      French Market, near by, there was some noble coffee. This,
      however, would have to be bought, and Parson Jones had scruples.</p>
    <p>"You see, Jools, every man has his conscience to guide him, which
      it does so in"&#8212;</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes!" cried St.-Ange, "conscien'; thad is the bez, Posson
      Jone'. Certainlee! I am a <i>Catholique</i>, you is a 
<span id="CpossonF18"></span><a href="#CpossonN18"><i>schismatique</i></a>;
      you thing it is wrong to dring some coffee&#8212;well, then, it <i>is</i>
      wrong; you thing it is wrong to make the sugah to ged the so large
      price&#8212;well, then, it <i>is</i> wrong; I thing it is right&#8212;well,
      then, it is right; it is all 'abit; <span id="CpossonF19"></span><a href="#CpossonN19"><i>c'est tout</i></a>. What a man
      thing is right, <i>is right</i>; 'tis all 'abit. A man muz nod go
      again' his conscien'. My faith! do you thing I would go again' my
      conscien'? <span id="CpossonF20"></span><a href="#CpossonN20"><i>Mais allons</i></a>, led us go and ged some coffee."</p>
    <p>"Jools."</p>
    <p>"W'at?"</p>
    <p>"Jools, it ain't the drinkin' of coffee, but the buyin' of it on
      a Sabbath. You must really excuse me, Jools, it's again'
      conscience, you know."</p>
    <p>"Ah!" said St.-Ange, "<span id="CpossonF21"></span><a href="#CpossonN21"><i>c'est</i></a> very true. For you it would be
      a sin, <i>mais</i> for me it is only 'abit. Rilligion is a very
      strange; I know a man one time, he thing it was wrong to go to
      cock-fight Sunday evening. I thing it is all 'abit. <i>Mais</i>,
      come, Posson Jone'; I have got one friend, Miguel; led us go at
      his house and ged some coffee. Come; Miguel have no familie; only
      him and Joe&#8212;always like to see friend; <i>allons</i>, led us come
      yonder."</p>
    <p>"Why, Jools, my dear friend, you know," said the shamefaced
      parson, "I never visit on Sundays."</p>
    <p>"Never w'at?" asked the astounded Creole.</p>
    <p>"No," said Jones, smiling awkwardly.</p>
    <p>"Never visite?"</p>
    <p>"Exceptin' sometimes amongst church-members," said Parson Jones.</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais</i>," said the seductive St.-Ange, "Miguel and Joe is
      church-member'&#8212;certainlee! They love to talk about rilligion. Come
      at Miguel and talk about some rilligion. I am nearly expire for me
      coffee."</p>
    <p>Parson Jones took his hat from beneath his chair and rose up.</p>
    <p>"Jools," said the weak giant, "I ought to be in church right
      now."</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais</i>, the church is right yond' at Miguel, yes. Ah!"
      continued St.-Ange, as they descended the stairs, "I thing every
      man muz have the rilligion he like' the bez&#8212;me, I like the <i>Catholique</i>
      rilligion the bez&#8212;for me it <i>is</i> the bez. Every man will
      sure go to heaven if he like his rilligion the bez."</p>
    <p>"Jools," said the West-Floridian, laying his great hand tenderly
      upon the Creole's shoulder, as they stepped out upon the <span id="CpossonF22"></span><a href="#CpossonN22"><i>banquette</i></a>,
      "do you think you have any shore hopes of heaven?"</p>
    <p>"Yaas!" replied St.-Ange; "I am sure-sure. I thing everybody will
      go to heaven. I thing you will go, <i>et</i> I thing Miguel will
      go, <i>et</i> Joe&#8212;everybody, I thing&#8212;<i>mais</i>, h-of course, not
      if they not have been christen'. Even I thing some niggers will
      go."</p>
    <p>"Jools," said the parson, stopping in his walk&#8212;"Jools, I <i>don't</i>
      want to lose my niggah."</p>
    <p>"Yon will not loose him. With Baptiste he <i>cannot</i> ged
      loose."</p>
    <p>But Colossus's master was not re-assured.</p>
    <p>"Now," said he, still tarrying, "this is jest the way; had I of
      gone to church&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Posson Jone'," said Jules.</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"I tell you. We goin' to church!"</p>
    <p>"Will you?" asked Jones, joyously.</p>
    <p>"<i>Allons</i>, come along," said Jules, taking his elbow.</p>
    <p>They walked down the Rue Chartres, passed several corners, and by
      and by turned into a cross street. The parson stopped an instant
      as they were turning and looked back up the street.</p>
    <p>"W'at you lookin'?" asked his companion.</p>
    <p>"I thought I saw Colossus," answered the parson, with an anxious
      face; "I reckon 'twa'n't him, though." And they went on.</p>
    <p>The street they now entered was a very quiet one. The eye of any
      chance passer would have been at once drawn to a broad, heavy,
      white brick edifice on the lower side of the way, with a flag-pole
      standing out like a bowsprit from one of its great windows, and a
      pair of lamps hanging before a large closed entrance. It was a
      theatre, sub-let to gamblers. At this morning hour all
      was still, and the only sign of life was a knot of little barefoot
      girls gathered within its narrow shade, and each carrying an
      infant relative. Into this place the parson and M. St.-Ange
      entered, the little nurses jumping up from the sills to let them
      pass in.</p>
    <p>A half-hour may have passed. At the end of that time the whole
      juvenile company were laying alternate eyes and ears to the
      chinks, to gather what they could of an interesting quarrel going
      on within.</p>
    <p>"I did not, saw! I given you no cause of offence, saw! It's not
      so, saw! Mister Jools simply mistaken the house, thinkin' it was a
      Sabbath-school! No such thing, saw; I <i>ain't</i> bound to bet!
      Yes, I kin git out. Yes, without bettin'! I hev a right to my
      opinion; I reckon I'm a <i>white man</i>, saw! No saw! I on'y
      said I didn't think you could get the game on them cards. 'Sno
      such thing, saw! I do <i>not</i> know how to play! I wouldn't hev
      a roscal's money ef I should win it! Shoot, ef you dare! You can
      kill me, but you cayn't scare me! No, I shayn't bet! I'll die
      first! Yes, saw; Mr. Jools can bet for me if he admires to; I
      ain't his mostah."</p>

    <p>Here the speaker seemed to direct his words to St.-Ange.</p>
    <p>"Saw, I don't understand you, saw. I never said I'd loan you
      money to bet for me. I didn't suspicion this from you, saw. No, I
      won't take any more lemonade; it's the most notorious stuff I ever
      drank, saw!"</p>
    <p>M. St.-Ange's replies were in <i>falsetto</i> and not without
      effect; for presently the parson's indignation and anger began to
      melt. "Don't ask me, Jools, I can't help you. It's no use; it's a
      matter of conscience with me, Jools."</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais oui!</i> 'tis a matt' of conscien' wid me, the same."</p>
    <p>"But, Jools, the money's none o' mine, nohow; it belongs to
      Smyrny, you know."</p>
    <p>"If I could make jus' <i>one</i> bet," said the persuasive
      St.-Ange, "I would leave this place, fas'-fas', yes. If I had
      thing&#8212;<i>mais</i> I did not soupspicion this from you, Posson
      Jone'"&#8212;</p>
    <p>"Don't, Jools, don't!"</p>
    <p>"No! Posson Jone'."</p>
    <p>"You're bound to win?" said the parson, wavering.</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais certainement!</i> But it is not to win that I want; 'tis
      me conscien'&#8212;me honor!"</p>
    <p>"Well, Jools, I hope I'm not a-doin' no wrong. I'll loan you some
      of this money if you say you'll come right out 'thout takin' your
      winnin's."</p>
    <p>All was still. The peeping children could see the parson as he
      lifted his hand to his breast-pocket. There it paused a moment in
      bewilderment, then plunged to the bottom. It came back empty, and
      fell lifelessly at his side. His head dropped upon his breast, his
      eyes were for a moment closed, his broad palms were lifted and
      pressed against his forehead, a tremor seized him, and he fell all
      in a lump to the floor. The children ran off with their
      infant-loads, leaving Jules St.-Ange swearing by all his deceased
      relatives, first to Miguel and Joe, and then to the lifted parson,
      that he did not know what had become of the money "except if" the
      black man had got it.</p>
    <p>In the rear of ancient New Orleans, beyond the sites of the old
      rampart, (a trio of Spanish forts,) where the town has since
      sprung up and grown old, green with all the luxuriance of the wild
      Creole summer, lay the Congo Plains. Here stretched the canvas of
      the historic Cayetano, who Sunday after Sunday sowed the sawdust
      for his circus-ring.</p>
    <p>But to-day the great showman had fallen short of his printed
      promise. The hurricane had come by night, and with one fell swash
      had made an irretrievable sop of every thing. The circus trailed
      away its bedraggled magnificence, and the ring was cleared for the
      bull.</p>
    <p>Then the sun seemed to come out and work for the people. "See,"
      said the Spaniards, looking up at the glorious sky with its great,
      white fleets drawn off upon the horizon&#8212;"see&#8212;heaven smiles upon
      the bull-fight!"</p>
    <p>In the high upper seats of the rude amphitheatre sat the
      gayly-decked wives and daughters of the Gascons, from the <span id="CpossonF23"></span><a href="#CpossonN23"><i>m&eacute;tairies</i></a>
      along the Ridge, and the chattering Spanish women of the Market,
      their shining hair un-bonneted to the sun. Next below were their
      husbands and lovers in Sunday blouses, milkmen, butchers, bakers,
      black-bearded fishermen, Sicilian fruiterers, swarthy Portuguese
      sailors, in little woollen caps, and strangers of the graver sort;
      mariners of England, Germany, and Holland. The lowest seats were
      full of trappers, smugglers, Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>, drinking
      and singing; <i>Am&eacute;ricains</i>, too&#8212;more's the shame&#8212;from
      the upper rivers&#8212;who will not keep their seats&#8212;who ply the bottle,
      and who will get home by and by and tell how wicked Sodom is;
      broad-brimmed, silver-braided Mexicans, too, with their copper
      cheeks and bat's eyes and their tinkling spurred heels. Yonder, in
      that quieter section, are the quadroon women in their black lace
      shawls&#8212;and there is Baptiste; and below them are the turbaned
      black women, and there is&#8212;but he vanishes&#8212;Colossus.</p>
    <p>The afternoon is advancing, yet the sport, though loudly
      demanded, does not begin. The <i>Am&eacute;ricains</i> grow
      derisive and find pastime in gibes and raillery They mock the
      various Latins with their national inflections, and answer their
      scowls with laughter. Some of the more aggressive shout pretty
      French greetings to the women of Gascony, and one bargeman, amid
      peals of applause, stands on a seat and hurls a kiss to the
      quadroons. The mariners of England, Germany, and Holland, as
      spectators, like the fun, while the Spaniards look black and cast
      defiant imprecations upon their persecutors. Some Gascons, with
      timely caution, pick their women out and depart, running a
      terrible fire of gallantries.</p>
    <p>In hope of truce, a new call is raised for the bull: "The bull,
      the bull!&#8212;hush!"</p>
    <p>In a tier near the ground a man is standing and calling&#8212;standing
      head and shoulders above the rest&#8212;calling in the <i>Am&eacute;ricaine</i>
      tongue. Another man, big and red, named Joe, and a handsome little
      Creole in elegant dress and full of laughter, wish to stop him,
      but the flat-boatmen, ha-ha-ing and cheering, will not suffer it.
      Ah, through some shameful knavery of the men, into whose hands he
      has fallen, he is drunk! Even the women can see that; and now he
      throws his arms wildly and raises his voice until the whole great
      circle hears it. He is preaching!</p>
    <p>Ah! kind Lord, for a special providence now! The men of his own
      nation&#8212;men from the land of the open English Bible and temperance
      cup and song are cheering him on to mad disgrace. And now another
      call for the appointed sport is drowned by the flat-boatmen
      singing the ancient tune of Mear. You can hear the words&#8212;</p>

<p>
<span id="CpossonF23a"></span><a href="#CpossonN23a">"Old Grimes is dead, that good old soul"</a></p>


    <p>&#8212;From ribald lips and throats turned brazen with laughter, from
      singers who toss their hats aloft and roll in their seats; the
      chorus swells to the accompaniment of a thousand brogans&#8212;</p>
    <p>"He used to wear an old gray coat<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All buttoned down before."</p>
    <p>A ribboned man in the arena is trying to be heard, and the Latins
      raise one mighty cry for silence. The big red man gets a hand over
      the parson's mouth, and the ribboned man seizes his moment.</p>
    <p>"They have been endeavoring for hours," he says, "to draw the
      terrible animals from their dens, but such is their strength and
      fierceness, that"&#8212;</p>
    <p>His voice is drowned. Enough has been heard to warrant the
      inference that the beasts cannot be whipped out of the
      storm-drenched cages to which menagerie-life and long starvation
      have attached them, and from the roar of indignation the man of
      ribbons flies. The noise increases. Men are standing up by
      hundreds, and women are imploring to be let out of the turmoil.
      All at once, like the bursting of a dam, the whole mass pours down
      into the ring. They sweep across the arena and over the showman's
      barriers. Miguel gets a frightful trampling. Who cares for gates
      or doors? They tear the beasts' houses bar from bar, and, laying
      hold of the gaunt buffalo, drag him forth by feet, ears, and tail;
      and in the midst of the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, still head and
      shoulders above all, wilder, with the cup of the wicked, than any
      beast, is the man of God from the Florida parishes!</p>
    <p>In his arms he bore&#8212;and all the people shouted at once when they
      saw it&#8212;the tiger. He had lifted it high up with its back to his
      breast, his arms clasped under its shoulders; the wretched brute
      had curled up caterpillar-wise, with its long tail against its
      belly, and through its filed teeth grinned a fixed and impotent
      wrath. And Parson Jones was shouting:</p>
    <p>"The tiger and the buffler <i>shell</i> lay down together! You
      dah to say they shayn't and I'll comb you with this varmint from
      head to foot! The tiger and the buffler <i>shell</i> lay down
      together. They <i>shell!</i> Now, you, Joe! Behold! I am here to
      see it done. The lion and the buffler <i>shell</i> lay down
      together!"</p>

<A HREF="cable--posson_jone_files/posson_jones_with_tiger.jpg"><IMG SRC="cable--posson_jone_files/posson_jones_with_tiger.jpg" BORDER="0">
</A>



    <p>Mouthing these words again and again, the parson forced his way
      through the surge in the wake of the buffalo. This creature the
      Latins had secured by a lariat over his head, and were dragging
      across the old rampart and into a street of the city.</p>
    <p>The northern races were trying to prevent, and there was
      pommelling and knocking down, cursing and knife-drawing, until
      Jules St.-Ange was quite carried away with the fun, laughed,
      clapped his hands, and swore with delight, and ever kept close to
      the gallant parson.</p>
    <p>Joe, contrariwise, counted all this child's-play an interruption.
      He had come to find Colossus and the money. In an unlucky moment
      he made bold to lay hold of the parson, but a piece of the broken
      barriers in the hands of a flat-boatman felled him to the sod, the
      terrible crowd swept over him, the lariat was cut and the giant
      parson hurled the tiger upon the buffalo's back. In another
      instant both brutes were dead at the hands of the mob; Jones was
      lifted from his feet, and prating of Scripture and the millennium,
      of Paul at Ephesus and Daniel in the "buffler's" den, was borne
      aloft upon the shoulders of the huzzaing <i>Am&eacute;ricains</i>.
      Half an hour later he was sleeping heavily on the floor of a cell
      in the <span id="CpossonF24"></span> <a href="#CpossonN24"><i>calaboza</i></a>.</p>
    <p>When Parson Jones awoke, a bell was somewhere tolling for
      midnight. Somebody was at the door of his cell with a key. The
      lock grated, the door swung, the turnkey looked in and stepped
      back, and a ray of moonlight fell upon M. Jules St.-Ange. The
      prisoner sat upon the empty shackles and ring-bolt in the centre
      of the floor.</p>
    <p>"Misty Posson Jone'," said the visitor, softly.</p>
    <p>"O Jools!"</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais</i>, w'at de matter, Posson Jone'?"</p>
    <p>"My sins, Jools, my sins!"</p>

<A HREF="cable--posson_jone_files/posson_jones_in_jail.jpg"><IMG SRC="cable--posson_jone_files/posson_jones_in_jail.jpg" BORDER="0">
</A>

    <p>"Ah! Posson Jone', is that something to cry, because a man get
      sometime a litt' bit intoxicate? <i>Mais</i>, if a man keep <i>all
        the time</i> intoxicate, I think that is again' the conscien'."</p>
    <p>"Jools, Jools, your eyes is darkened&#8212;oh! Jools, Where's my pore
      old niggah?"</p>
    <p>"Posson Jone', never min'; he is wid Baptiste."</p>
    <p>"Where?"</p>
    <p>"I don' know w'ere&#8212;<i>mais</i> he is wid Baptiste. Baptiste is a
      beautiful to take care of somebody."</p>
    <p>"Is he as good as you, Jools?" asked Parson Jones, sincerely.</p>
    <p>Jules was slightly staggered.</p>
    <p>"You know, Posson Jone', you know, a nigger cannot be good as a
      w'ite man&#8212;<i>mais</i> Baptiste is a good nigger."</p>
    <p>The parson moaned and dropped his chin into his hands.</p>
    <p>"I was to of left for home to-morrow, sun-up, on the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Isabella </span>schooner. Pore
      Smyrny!" He deeply sighed.</p>
    <p>"Posson Jone'," said Jules, leaning against the wall and smiling,
      "I swear you is the moz funny man I ever see. If I was you I would
      say, me, 'Ah! 'ow I am lucky! the money I los', it was not mine,
      anyhow!' My faith! shall a man make hisse'f to be the more sorry
      because the money he los' is not his? Me, I would say, 'it is a
      specious providence.'</p>
    <p>"Ah! Misty Posson Jone'," he continued, "you make a so droll
      sermon ad the bull-ring. Ha! ha! I swear I thing you can make
      money to preach thad sermon many time ad the theatre St. Philippe.
      Hah! you is the moz brave dat I never see, <i>mais</i> ad the
      same time the moz rilligious man. Where I'm goin' to fin' one
      priest to make like dat? <i>Mais,</i> why you can't cheer up an'
      be 'appy? Me, if I should be miserabl' like that I would kill
      meself."</p>
    <p>The countryman only shook his head.</p>
    <p>"<i>Bien,</i> Posson Jone', I have the so good news for you."</p>
    <p>The prisoner looked up with eager inquiry.</p>
    <p>"Las' evening when they lock' you, I come right off at M. De
      Blanc's house to get you let out of de calaboose; M. De Blanc he
      is the judge. So soon I was entering&#8212;'Ah! Jules, me boy, juz the
      man to make complete the game!' Posson Jone', it was a specious
      providence! I win in t'ree hours more dan six hundred dollah!
      Look." He produced a mass of bank-notes, <i>bons</i>, and
      due-bills.</p>
    <p>"And you got the pass?" asked the parson, regarding the money
      with a strange sadness. <br>
    </p>
    <p>"It is here; it take the effect so soon the daylight."</p>
    <p>"Jools, my friend, your kindness is in vain."</p>
    <p>The Creole's face became a perfect blank.</p>
    <p>"Because," said the parson, "for two reasons: firstly, I hare
      broken the laws, and ought to stand the penalty; and secondly&#8212;you
      must really excuse me, Jools, you know, but the pass has been got
      onfairly, I'm afeerd. You told the judge I was innocent; and in
      neither case it don't become a Christian (which I hope I can still
      say I am one) to 'do evil that good may come.' I muss stay."</p>
    <p>M. St.-Ange stood up aghast, and for a moment speechless, at this
      exhibition of moral heroism; but an artifice was presently hit
      upon. "<i>Mais</i>, Posson Jone'!"&#8212;in his old <i>falsetto</i>&#8212;"de
      order&#8212;you cannot read it, it is in French&#8212;compel you to go h-out,
      sir!"</p>
    <p>"Is that so?" cried the parson, bounding up with radiant face&#8212;"is
      that so, Jools?"</p>
    <p>The young man nodded, smiling; but, though he smiled, the
      fountain of his tenderness was opened. He made the sign of the
      cross as the parson knelt in prayer, and even whispered "Hail
      Mary," etc., quite through, twice over.</p>
    <p>Morning broke in summer glory upon a cluster of villas behind the
      city, nestled under live-oaks and magnolias on the banks of a deep
      bayou, and known as Suburb St. Jean.</p>
    <p>With the first beam came the West-Floridian and the Creole out
      upon the bank below the village. Upon the parson's arm hung a pair
      of antique saddle-bags. Baptiste limped wearily behind; both his
      eyes were encircled with broad, blue rings, and one cheek-bone
      bore the official impress of every knuckle of Colossus's left
      hand. The "beautiful to take care of somebody" had lost his
      charge. At mention of the negro he became wild, and, half in
      English, half in the "gumbo" dialect, said murderous things.
      Intimidated by Jules to calmness, he became able to speak
      confidently on one point; he could, would, and did swear that
      Colossus had gone home to the Florida parishes; he was almost
      certain; in fact, he thought so.</p>
    <p>There was a clicking of pulleys as the three appeared upon the
      bayou's margin, and Baptiste pointed out, in the deep shadow of a
      great oak, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Isabella</span>,
      moored among the bulrushes, and just spreading her sails for
      departure. Moving down to where she lay, the parson and his friend
      paused on the bank, loath to say farewell.</p>
    <p>"O Jools!" said the parson, "supposin' Colossus ain't gone home!
      O Jools, if you'll look him out for me, I'll never forget you&#8212;I'll
      never forget you, nohow, Jools. No, Jools, I never will believe he
      taken that money. Yes, I know all niggahs will steal"&#8212;he set foot
      upon the gang-plank&#8212;"but Colossus wouldn't steal from me.
      Good-by."</p>
    <p>"Misty Posson Jone,'" said St.-Ange, putting his hand on the
      parson's arm with genuine affection, "hol' on. You see dis
      money&#8212;w'at I win las' night? Well, I win' it by a specious
      providence, ain't it?"</p>
    <p>"There's no tellin'," said the humbled Jones. "Providence</p>
    <p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.5in"> 'Moves in a mysterious way<br>
      His wonders to perform.'"</p>
    <p>"Ah!" cried the Creole, "<i>c'est</i> very true. I ged this money
      in the mysterieuze way. <i>Mais</i>, if I keep dis money, you
      know where it goin' be to-night?"</p>
    <p>"I really can't say," replied the parson.</p>
    <p>"Goin' to de dev'," said the sweetly-smiling yonng man.</p>
    <p>The schooner-captain, leaning against the shrouds, and even
      Baptiste, laughed outright.</p>
    <p>"O Jools, you mustn't!"</p>
    <p>"Well, den, w'at I shall do wid <i>it?</i>"</p>
    <p>"Any thing!" answered the parson; "better donate it away to some
      poor man"&#8212;</p>
    <p>"Ah! Misty Posson Jone', dat is w'at I want. You los' five
      hondred dollar'&#8212;'twas me fault."</p>
    <p>"No, it wa'n't, Jools."</p>
    <p>"<i>Mais</i>, it was!"</p>
    <p>"No!"</p>
    <p>"It <i>was</i> me fault! I <i>swear</i> it was me fault! <i>Mais</i>,
      here is five hondred dollar'; I wish you shall take it. Here! I
      don't got no use for money.&#8212;Oh, my faith! Posson Jone', you must
      not begin to cry some more."</p>
    <p>Parson Jones was choked with tears. When he found voice he said:</p>
    <p>"O Jools, Jools, Jools! my pore, noble, dear, misguidened friend!
      ef you hed of hed a Christian raisin'! May the Lord show you your
      errors better'n I kin, and bless you for your good intentions&#8212;oh,
      no! I cayn't touch that money with a ten-foot pole; it wa'n't
      rightly got; you must really excuse me, my dear friend, but I
      cayn't touch it."</p>
    <p>St.-Ange was petrified.</p>
    <p>"Good-by, dear Jools," continued the parson. "I'm in the Lord's
      haynds, and he's very merciful, which I hope and trust you'll find
      it out. Good-by!"&#8212;the schooner swang slowly off before the
      breeze&#8212;"good-by!"</p>
    <p>St.-Ange roused himself.</p>
    <p>"Posson Jone'! make me hany'ow <i>dis</i> promise: you never,
      never, <i>never</i> will come back to New Orleans."</p>
    <p>"Ah, Jools, the Lord willin', I'll never leave home again!"</p>
    <p>"All right!" cried the Creole; "I thing he's willin'. Adieu,
      Posson Jone'. My faith'! you are the so fighting an' moz
      rilligious man as I never saw! Adieu! Adieu!"</p>
    <p>Baptiste uttered a cry and presently ran by his master toward the
      schooner, his hands full of clods.</p>
    <p>St.-Ange looked just in time to see the sable form of Colossus of
      Rhodes emerge from the vessel's hold, and the pastor of Smyrna and
      Bethesda seize him in his embrace.</p>
    <p>"O Colossus! you outlandish old niggah! Thank the Lord! Thank the
      Lord!"</p>
    <p>The little Creole almost wept. He ran down the tow-path, laughing
      and swearing, and making confused allusion to the entire <i>personnel</i>
      and furniture of the lower regions.</p>
    <p>By odd fortune, at the moment that St.-Ange further demonstrated
      his delight by tripping his mulatto into a bog, the schooner came
      brushing along the reedy bank with a graceful curve, the sails
      flapped, and the crew fell to poling her slowly along.</p>
    <p>Parson Jones was on the deck, kneeling once more in prayer. His
      hat had fallen before him; behind him knelt his slave. In
      thundering tones he was confessing himself "a plumb fool," from
      whom "the conceit had been jolted out," and who had been made to
      see that even his "nigger had the longest head of the two."</p>
    <p>Colossus clasped his hands and groaned.</p>
    <p>The parson prayed for a contrite heart.</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes!" cried Colossus.</p>
    <p>The master acknowledged countless mercies.</p>
    <p>"Dat's so!" cried the slave.</p>
    <p>The master prayed that they might still be "piled on."</p>
    <p>"Glory!" cried the black man, clapping his hands; "pile on!"</p>
    <p>"An' now," continued the parson, "bring this pore, backslidin'
      jackace of a parson and this pore ole fool niggah back to thar
      home in peace!"</p>
    <p>"Pray fo' de money!" called Colossus.</p>
    <p>But the parson prayed for Jules.</p>
    <p>"Pray fo' de <i>money!</i>" repeated the negro.</p>
    <p>"And oh, give thy servant back that there lost money!"</p>
    <p>Colossus rose stealthily, and tiptoed by his still shouting
      master. St.-Ange, the captain, the crew, gazed in silent wonder at
      the strategist. Pausing but an instant over the master's hat to
      grin an acknowledgment of his beholders' speechless interest, he
      softly placed in it the faithfully-mourned and honestly prayed-for
      Smyrna fund; then, saluted by the gesticulative, silent applause
      of St.-Ange and the schooner-men, he resumed his first attitude
      behind his roaring master.</p>
    <p>"Amen!" cried Colossus, meaning to bring him to a close.</p>
    <p>"Onworthy though I be"&#8212;cried Jones.</p>
    <p>"<i>Amen!</i>" reiterated the negro.</p>
    <p>"A-a-amen!" said Parson Jones.</p>

    <p>He rose to his feet, and, stooping to take up his hat, beheld the
      well-known roll. As one stunned, he gazed for a moment upon his
      slave, who still knelt with clasped hands and rolling eyeballs;
      but when he became aware of the laughter and cheers that greeted
      him from both deck and shore, he lifted eyes and hands to heaven,
      and cried like the veriest babe. And when he looked at the roll
      again, and hugged and kissed it, St.-Ange tried to raise a second
      shout, but choked, and the crew fell to their poles.</p>
    <p>And now up runs Baptiste, covered with slime, and prepares to
      cast his projectiles. The first one fell wide of the mark; the
      schooner swung round into a long reach of water, where the breeze
      was in her favor; another shout of laughter drowned the
      maledictions of the muddy man; the sails filled; Colossus of
      Rhodes, smiling and bowing as hero of the moment, ducked as the
      main boom swept round, and the schooner, leaning slightly to the
      pleasant influence, rustled a moment over the bulrushes, and then
      sped far away down the rippling bayou.</p>
    <p>M. Jules St.-Ange stood long, gazing at the receding vessel as it
      now disappeared, now re-appeared beyond the tops of the high
      undergrowth; but, when an arm of the forest hid it finally from
      sight, he turned townward, followed by that fagged-out spaniel,
      his servant, saying, as he turned, "Baptiste."</p>
    <p>"<i>Mich&eacute;?</i>"</p>
    <p>"You know w'at I goin' do wid dis money?"</p>
    <p>"<i>Non, Mich&eacute;.</i>"</p>
    <p>"Well, you can strike me dead if I don't goin' to pay hall my
      debts! <i>Allons!</i>"</p>
    <p>He began a merry little song to the effect that his sweetheart
      was a wine-bottle, and master and man, leaving care behind,
      returned to the picturesque Rue Royale. The ways of Providence are
      indeed strange. In all Parson Jones's after-life, amid the many
      painful reminiscences of his visit to the City of the Plain, the
      sweet knowledge was withheld from him that by the light of the
      Christian virtue that shone from him even in his great fall, Jules
      St.-Ange <span id="CpossonF25"></span><a href="#CpossonN25">
arose, and went to his father</a> an honest man.</p>
