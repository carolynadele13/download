                      And gain his sanction to them, or I fear <br>
                      They'll not succeed. In such respect are held <br>

                      Thou hast a power which we cannot break ! <br>

                      Yet they brace us up, and give us double strength
                      <br>
                      For action ; and the bold hero oft achieves <br>

                      Ah, Garidel, I'm glad we meet to-day ! <br>
                      You find me in a flowing humor for our work. <br>
                      Hast thou performed the charge I gave thee ? <br>
                      <br>
                      GARIDEL. Yes <br>
                      <br>
                      I put the letter on her toilet table. <br>
                      <br>
                      AUB. Well, what result ? <br>
                      <br>
                      GAR. None she has not seen it. <br>
                      <br>
                      But prithee, Master Aubry, why not use <br>
                      Some means more certain in effect to part <br>
                      These foolish lovers ? These letters, well wrought
                      <br>
                      And plausible, 'tis true, can they reduce <br>
                      Love's hottest flame ? They may cause some pouting
                      ; <br>
                      But oaths and tears soon quell the anger raised <br>
                      By cloaked accusers 'gainst the one we love. <br>
                      <br>
                      AUB. 'Tis well to try this method first ; and
                      then, <br>
                      If not successful, I have other plans. <br>
                      <br>
                      GAR. And they are ? <br>
                      <br>
                      AUB. Listen, Garidel. Art thou <br>
                      <br>
                      An honest fellow, and can I be sure <br>
                      That if I give thee all my confidence, <br>
                      Thou'lt not deceive me ? <br>
                      <br>
                      GAR. What, Master Aubry, <br>
                      <br>
                      And do you ask me that ? But yesterday <br>
                      We did acknowledge to each other <br>
                      That nature round our hearts had wound a tie <br>
                      Of sympathy. Have you not often said, <br>
                      <br>
                      <br>

                      THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769 425 <br>
                      <br>
                      That, in the darkness of my brow, there was <br>
                      A something most congenial to thyself ? <br>
                      <br>
                      AUB. But answer, wilt thou aid me against VillerS,
                      <br>
                      And Villere's house to all extremity ? <br>
                      <br>
                      GAR. Pshaw ! <br>
                      <br>
                      Do not anger me. Have I not advised <br>
                      The use of stronger measures 'gainst them ? True,
                      <br>
                      Villere has been a father to me. <br>
                      He found me, when an infant, in a ditch, <br>
                      Thrown there by an inhuman mother. <br>
                      He picked me up, and had me nursed with care, <br>
                      And, cheated by the fairness of my skin, <br>
                      He thought me one of Europe's sickly race, <br>
                      And did adopt me as his son, and strove <br>
                      To teach me science and morality. <br>
                      But now I am among his servants classed ; <br>
                      For soon as I grew up my figure changed ; <br>
                      And this black hair, and eye, and bronzed face <br>
                      Proclaimed me one of that dread tribe of men <br>
                      Whose birthplace is the undivided wild, <br>
                      Whose law is in the power of their arms, <br>
                      Whose hate is trusted to a poisoned knife, <br>
                      Whose thirst is for the white man's blood, <br>
                      And whose ambition is to sweep away <br>
                      Those pale usurpers of this land <br>
                      Who seek to pen the freeborn Indian up <br>
                      And set a bound'ry to his roving steps. <br>
                      Listen, Aubry ! I feel as if the red man's God <br>
                      Had cast my lot amidst thy race to be <br>
                      An agent of our nation's vengeance. <br>
                      Think ye I'll shrink from such a sacred task ? <br>
                      Though Villere still should call me his own son, <br>
                      I would begin with him. I'll end, perhaps, <br>
                      With you. <br>
                      <br>
                      AUB. With me ! <br>
                      <br>
                      GAR. Nay, speak not of yourself, <br>
                      <br>
                      But parley to your purposes. You have <br>
                      My service now ; use it while you may. <br>
                      <br>
                      AUB. (aside). A dreadful fellow this ; but I must
                      bend <br>
                      Awhile unto his temper. <br>
                      (To GARIDEL.) Well, I see <br>
                      <br>
                      Thou art the man I sought for, Garidel. <br>
                      I'll trust thee to the whole. Listen ! If I fail <br>

                      Jealousy why, Garidel, I'll then attack <br>
                      <br>
                      That very beauty which enslaves my heart <br>

                      And causes all my pain ; ay, and to which <br>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      I'll destroy it, and what / could not gain <br>

                      <br>
                      Of her face, will raise it full of blots <br>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      Disgusting to every one around her, <br>

                      And even to herself. Tell me ; think ye <br>

                      / will apply it. But is its venom sure ? <br>
                      Say, from what propitious fiend of hell <br>
                      Did you the drug procure ? <br>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      How to find her ; for, if she sells such drugs <br>
                      As this, her traffic might be profited <br>
                      By my acquaintance. <br>

                      <br>
                      Of that dead cypress tree which stands, <br>
                      Like a giant skeleton, behind the common <br>
                      Burial ground, without the city, <br>
                      Her hut she has erected. It seems a heap <br>
                      Of half -burned logs, and boards, and earth <br>
                      Thrown there by accident. She chose the spot <br>
                      For it is solitary, and near the fens <br>
                      Where toads, and snakes, and poisonous weeds <br>
                      Are trod upon at every step. 'Tis near <br>
                      The graves and crumbling tombs from whence she
                      gets <br>
                      Most fit ingredients for the hellish spells <br>
                      She deals in. The day she gave me that, <br>
                      I found her in her low and dingy cabin <br>
                      Oouched on the humid earth watching, <br>

                      With a curious care, some working spell <br>

                      A reddened light fell o'er the African ; <br>
                      Her twisted hair, white as a maiden's shroud, <br>
                      Contrasted with her ebon skin ; and her limbs, <br>
                      Shrivelled by age, were but half covered 'neath <br>
                      Some filthy, partly -colored rags. <br>
                      A laugh, which sounded like a tiger's growl ; <br>
                      A smile, as when he shows his bloody teeth <br>
                      Her heavy lips relaxed, while, searching mine, <br>
                      She raised her serpent eyes. I tremble <br>
                      Even now. <br>

                      Deliberate measures must we take, and <br>

Fair colony has, by our gracious King, <br />
Louis the beloved, been surrendered <br />
Unto his Majesty the sovereign Charles <br />
Of Spain. I need not tell you of the greatness, <br />
The clemency and wisdom, of this prince. <br />
Obedience to him is our duty. <br />
Long have I waited with impatience, <br />
That o'er us should begin his rule. At last <br />
My longing wishes are all satisfied. <br />

Ascends the river and will soon be here. <br />

"Tis true, that moved by futile hope, and strong <br />
<br />
Attachment for the mother country, <br />
<br />
Our citizens did drive good Don Ulloa <br />
<br />
From their native shore ; but of this wrong deed <br />
<br />
They have, I hope, repented. Ambitious <br />
<br />
Factions and discontented men, I know, <br />
<br />
Have, by their cunning and exciting speeches, <br />
<br />
Stirred their noble spirits to rebellion ; <br />
<br />
But quick submission will, I hope, soon show <br />
<br />
That 'tis but a moment's aberration <br />
<br />
Which leads them thus, with folly, to disown <br />

The will and power of their rightful king. <br />

Your Excellence will pardon me, if my <br />
Opinion differs from your own. I think <br />
Our citizens are not thus unsteady ; <br />
Nor are they guided by a blind caprice. <br />
What they have done, was calmly done, and not <br />
In headlong haste. They have resolved to rise, <br />
And desperate resistance to oppose <br />
To the invading horde ; and their honor <br />
They have pledged, at price of blood, to save <br />
Their country from oppression. <br />

LAF. (aside). Ay, tremble, <br />
<br />
Ye traitors, for they'll keep that sacred oath. <br />

ATJB. Much does it hurt me to confess the great <br />
Displeasure I do feel, Sir Yillere, now <br />
To find that you, whose discreet judgments have <br />
So often shed benignant influence o'er <br />
This council board, should thus have joined the voice, <br />
The raging of the factious few, whose acts, <br />
Thoughtless and criminal, ere long might bring <br />
An evil scourge upon Louisiana, <br />
And on themselves complete destruction. <br />

Or mend the widening breach. I fondly thought <br />

<br />
The unruly current of this folly <br />

How soon this white head of mine is felled ; still <br />
Persist I in my first opinion. Wisdom, <br />
You say, has until now her breath infused <br />
Into my words ; she has not quit my side. <br />
No factious counsel have I given ; but <br />
The people the whole people have arisen, <br />
And Spain's mercenaries shall dye their swords <br />
In Creole blood, and tread upon an host <br />
Of slain, before they gain the city's walls. <br />
<br />
DENOY. Ay, Aubry ; and I have joined them too, and <br />
Have pledged my honor also with the rest ; <br />

My sword must triumph in the battle, or <br />
My life be paid a tribute to the grave. <br />

These men were bought by dirty Spanish gold ? <br />
You've called them traitors you are the traitor I <br />
Do you not hold a correspondence close <br />
With the governor of Havana, say ? <br />
And sent you not unto the court of Spain <br />
The names of those who led the noble band <br />
Which drove proud Don Ulloa from our shore ? <br />
I tell you, Aubry, you are the traitor. <br />

MRS. YIL. My Adelaide, <br />
<br />
Thy choice, indeed, doth satisfaction give <br />
To thy fond mother. Of all the noble <br />
Youths who crowd to catch one softened ray <br />
From those bright eyes of thine, more worthy none <br />
Than young Lafreniere is to be thy lord ; <br />
His form is cast in manly beauty's mould, <br />
His heart is virtue's richest, purest gem, <br />
His mind a palace genius lighteth up. <br />
<br />
ADE. Ah, mother, thou dost almost flatter him. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Faultless, I do not say he is. <br />
<br />
ADE. Some faults <br />
<br />
He has ; but, like clouds around the sun, <br />
They're gilded over by the shining rays <br />
Cast from the brightness of his qualities, <br />
And only serve to give a high relief <br />
To all the splendor of his virtue. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Say, <br />
<br />
Think ye not he is presumptuous ? <br />
<br />
ADE. No, no. <br />
<br />
Presumption is, I think, the distance 'tween <br />
What men themselves believe to be the worth, <br />
The virtue, talent, power, they possess, <br />
And what their real value is. Pray, then, <br />
To what has young Lafreniere yet pretended <br />
In which he overprized himself ? <br />

And court the favor of less tender dames : <br />
Glory and carnage, and bright liberty, <br />
Are now the mistresses to whom they bow, <br />
And deck their forms in warlike garb to woo. <br />
Think, mother, that our verdant fields will soon <br />
In gory streams be soaked ; and that many friends <br />
We love, 'neath hostile swords may sink. Ah ! think, <br />
That my father, too, may fall amidst the fight, <br />
Pouring his life-blood on his native soil <br />
Dying all gashed and pierced and trampled o'er <br />
By charging horses and the reckless feet <br />
Of rushing thousands. (The noises cm <br />

Of never meeting more ? <br />

YIL. Not so, my spouse. <br />

Let not thus fear victorious hold the sway <br />
Of thy true heart. Let rather pleasing hopes <br />
Dispel thy cloudy bodings of the future. <br />

And gain the succor of our red allies. <br />
<br />
From thence, in haste, I'll wend my lengthened way <br />
<br />
To ask assistance of that noble race <br />
<br />
Who dwell along Atlantic's western shore, <br />
<br />
And who are now, in proud array, opposed <br />
<br />
To proud Britannia's tyranny. <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. Thanks to Lafreniere for this happy care. <br />
Much will I try, the pleasure now he gives <br />
This sorrowing breast, in double fold to pay. <br />
<br />
ADE. But, father, dost thou leave us e'en to-day ? <br />
<br />
YIL. Yes, all is ready, and I go e'en now ; <br />
My steed awaits me at the gate. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. My love, <br />
<br />
Why haste you thus ? Oh, wait until the morn ! <br />
Stay with us yet this day. <br />
<br />
YIL. Each minute counts. <br />
<br />
Come, then, embrace thy husband e'er he goes. (They embrace.} <br />
My country needs the promptest services, <br />
And I must fly upon the wings of haste. <br />
My daughter, go, tell Garidel prepare <br />
<br />
To start upon this voyage with me. [Exit ADELAIDE. <br />
<br />
Come, my love, be not depressed. I'll send thee news <br />
Of all that doth befall me as I go. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. And must it then be so ? But, Yillere, say, <br />
Wilt thou be absent long ? <br />
<br />
YIL. But six short weeks <br />
<br />
Will suffice for my duty. I'll then return ; <br />
And Heaven grant I find my country free, <br />
The Spaniards beaten, and untroubled peace <br />
Around our happy fireside ! And then, <br />
My wife, the long retarded union of <br />
Our child with Lafreniere once solemnized, <br />
In tranquil solitude we'll pass the days <br />
Of our last years. <br />
<br />
\Reenter ADELAIDE.] <br />
<br />
ADE. Father, thy bidding's done ; Garidel is ready. <br />
<br />
YIL. I thank thee, child ; <br />
<br />
But come before thy father goes, and take his blessing. <br />
<br />
(He kisses her forehead, and she kneels.} <br />
My daughter, Heaven bless thee, <br />
Ward off all dangers from this lovely head, <br />
Keep thy fragile frame from pain or sickness, <br />
Preserve thee to console my coming age, <br />

And make thee thy Lafreniere's worthy bride. (She rises.) <br />
<br />
Remember oft thy father ; in thy prayers, <br />
<br />
Each eve and morn, send up to God's high throne <br />
<br />
An earnest supplication for success <br />
<br />
To all his labor, and his safe return. <br />
<br />
ADE. Oh ! could I forget that duty, father ? <br />
Oh, may my faint petition reach the ear <br />
Of Him who holds our fate within His hand ! <br />
He'll not refuse what asks a guileless heart : <br />
He'll shield thee, father, and will keep thee for us. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Nay, go not yet. <br />
<br />
YIL. Indeed, I must depart. <br />
<br />
My country calls. Adieu ! (They embrace and part.} <br />
<br />
ADE. Adieu ! <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. Adieu ! [Exit VILLERE. <br />
<br />
ADE. O mother, I am faint ! This unforewarned <br />
Departure of my father striketh hard <br />
Upon my heart, and makes me feel quite sick. <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. (wetting her kerchief from the vial). Here, my <br />
<br />
daughter, here ; respire this, my love, <br />
And pour it o'er thy cheeks, and neck, and temples ; <br />
'Twill spur the blood that stoppeth in thy veins. <br />

GAR. (aside}. Ha ! <br />
<br />
(To MRS. VILLERE.) <br />
<br />
Dear madam, I come to bid adieu <br />
To you and kind Miss Adelaide. <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. Thank thee, <br />
<br />
Garidel, for this attention. Good-by. <br />
I wish thee a pleasant voyage, and hope <br />
That nought but good will come across thy path. <br />
<br />
GAR. Thank thee, good lady ; but is Miss Adelaide <br />
Unwell ? she looks quite pale. <br />
<br />
ADE. A little faint <br />
<br />
'Tis nothing this will drive it soon away. <br />
But, Garidel, take good care of father <br />
Let nothing do him harm. <br />
<br />
GAR. Long as this arm <br />
<br />
Can move, it shall be lifted to protect <br />
My benefactor. Adieu ! (GARIDEL shakes the hands of loth.} <br />

<br />
MRS. VIL. Indeed, <br />
<br />
Garidel is well worthy of the care <br />
That on him Villere has bestowed ; but say, <br />
My daughter, art thou still unwell ? <br />
<br />
ADE. "Tis past <br />
<br />
I'm quite recovered. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Well, then, I leave thee ; <br />
<br />
I have some duties to attend to. (They kiss.} <br />
<br />
[Exit MRS. VILLERE.] <br />
<br />
ADE. Ah! <br />
<br />
How full of pain this hour is, and how <br />
My feeble heart doth throb with suffering ! <br />
<br />
(Sees a letter on the toilet.} <br />
<br />
Ah, a letter ! 'Tis addressed to me. What can <br />
It be ? (Opens it and reads.} " Adelaide, thy love's bestowed <br />
On one unworthy ; and the hot passion <br />
He pretends, a false heart disguises. <br />
His high ambition and his secret plans <br />
Force him to seek an union which will gain <br />
A strong support to all his wild designs. <br />
And, lady, though he feels no spark of love, <br />
Yet still he woos thee for thy name, and will <br />
Perhaps e'en yet sufficient power have <br />
To make thee spurn the warning of a friend." <br />
Ah ! can this be true, or is it calumny ? <br />
O Lafreniere, couldst thou deceive me thus ? <br />
Oh, double blow of pitiless misfortune ! <br />
{Enter LAFRENIERE.] <br />
<br />
LAF. Ah, Adelaide ! thou seem'st unwell, my love. <br />
Say, what weighs thee down so heavily ? <br />
What ! is't on me thy angry frowns are bent ? <br />
What have I done to merit such reception ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Leave me this instant, sir ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Nay? sa y n t so. <br />
<br />
Thou art not serious, Adelaide. Ah, <br />
That blush which doth suffuse thy lovely cheek <br />
Methinks doth tell another tale ! <br />
<br />
ADE. Blush, sir ! <br />
<br />
The red that rose upon my brow doth mark <br />
My great displeasure at the sight of thee. <br />
<br />
LAF. Heaven ! what crime have I committed ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Say, <br />
<br />
Art thou not false, and is not Ambition <br />

<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 443 <br />
<br />
The only dame whose favors thou dost court <br />
When thou dost kneel to me ? <br />
<br />
LAF. 'Tis true I am <br />
<br />
Ambitious ; but, my Adelaide, I swear <br />
Thou'rt joined with my ambition's brightest dream ; <br />
And laurels, riches, fame, I'd cast away <br />
As childish baubles, nor would I aspire <br />
To aught above the name of honest man, <br />
Did I not think to share these things with thee. <br />
<br />
ADE. Most bravely, frankly, said ; and thou too canst <br />
Thine honor and thy truth both lay aside <br />
With her whose weakness ye'd beguile. Sir, <br />
I have friends who o'er my welfare watch, <br />
And whose kind care detected have thy plans <br />
Thy wily, base, ungenerous plots. <br />
<br />
LAF. (kneeling). Upon my knees I pray thee, Adelaide, <br />
Tell me what whim is this. What black falsehood <br />
Hast thou heard which makes thee doubt, what ne'er <br />
Until to-day hath been impeached by woman or <br />
By man Lafreniere's honor ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Ay, 'tis thus <br />
<br />
With all your sex : ye kneel and cringe ; <br />
With cheating words, and oaths, and promises, <br />
And whining prayers, ye do triumph o'er <br />
Our unsuspecting hearts ; and when we own <br />
Your power, and our love to masters change ; <br />
Poor feeble woman's duty then becomes <br />
To watch each caprice of a tyrant's will <br />
Live in his smile and wither 'neath his frown. <br />
<br />
LAF. (who has risen). Lady, I've done. Thou'lt hear from me <br />
<br />
no more <br />
<br />
Words prompted by my passion's ardor. Yet <br />
Do not think the fire that burns within <br />
This breast will cease to burn. Though smothered, <br />
'Twill not die, and, thus confined, 'twill torture <br />
None but me. My countrymen await me. <br />
Oh, may I lead them unto victory, <br />
And may /meet with death ! [Exit LAFRENIEKE. <br />
<br />
ADE. What have I done ? <br />
<br />
Why did I not show him this ? Laf Ah, no ! <br />
I must not call him back ; he would exult <br />
As in a victory. Proud of the strong <br />
Seductions of his mien and eloquence, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
444 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
He'd look upon me as a conquered slave. <br />
<br />
No, no : I'm full of love, yet I'm as proud <br />
<br />
As he. Ah, my mother ! To thee I'll haste <br />
<br />
For consolation to my stricken breast. \Exit~ <br />
<br />
SCENE 3. A Wood (Night). <br />
[Enter AUBEY, accompanied by RUFFIANS.] <br />
<br />
ATJB. Yes ; this is the place fixed by Garidel <br />
His note describes it well. Go ye and hide <br />
Behind these trees ; and, when I the signal give, <br />
Hush on Sir Villere ye know him all. Mind, <br />
Shed not one drop of blood, or ye shall not <br />
Be paid a single sou. Remember well, <br />
That he that's with him is a friend. Go. [Exit rujfians- <br />
<br />
Now, <br />
<br />
Villere, I think I'll make thee much repent <br />
This morning's insult, thrown with heedless hand <br />
Into my face. Villere my prisoner, <br />
My favor with the Spanish chief is doubly <br />
Sure ; and thus both interest and my hate <br />
I serve at once ; and yet I will myself <br />
Be safe, nor stand the danger of a blow. <br />
'Tis thus with prudence men should ever act, <br />
Nor rashly jeopardize their own lives <br />
In open combats of uncertain end. <br />
It is not all to serve the spite one feels, <br />
But most maturely should we weigh results. <br />
None would I hurt who useful to me are, <br />
Though I should hate them with a poisoned hate. <br />
But if I loved a man though that can't be <br />
I'd have him murdered if he barred my plans. <br />
These fights, done in the world's wide eye, create <br />
To one an host of angry enemies ; <br />
But 'tis the midnight blow, the killing draught, <br />
Which yield revenge while safety is not risked ; <br />
And on to-morrow I can give this hand <br />
Into the brother of the man it kills <br />
To-night. <br />
<br />
GAR. (outside). 'Tis a fit place. Good Sir Villere, <br />
Let us here dismount and seek the path : on foot <br />
We'll find it easier. Our steeds are tired <br />
Let's give them rest a while. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 445 <br />
<br />
AUB. Ah, here they come, <br />
<br />
I must conceal myself ; I'll not approach <br />
<br />
Until he's well secured and bound. [Exit AUBRY. <br />
<br />
[Enter GARIDEL and YILLERE.] <br />
<br />
VIL. Well, Garidel, <br />
<br />
With thy fancy for a shorter path, <br />
We're lost, and now must pass the dreary night <br />
In this cold morass. <br />
<br />
GAR. I promise it, good sir, <br />
<br />
That in a healthy bed you'll sleep this night, <br />
And 'neath a shelter most secure. (Thunder.) <br />
<br />
YIL. Hear that ! <br />
<br />
And we shall have a storm to make the night <br />
Most comfortably romantic. (Lightning and thunder.) <br />
<br />
GAR. Indeed, <br />
<br />
Sir Yillere, walk with me but some few steps : <br />
Surely I'll meet with friends. <br />
<br />
[Enter RUFFIANS slowly creeping behind.] <br />
<br />
YIL. Pshaw ! seest thou not <br />
<br />
That we are in the very swamp itself ? <br />
This delay distracts me. Oh, my country ! <br />
May Heaven shield thee till I send thee help. <br />
I fear the battle, on which turns thy fate, <br />
Will be decided e'er I send thee succor ; <br />
And that thy little band will be o'erwhelmed. <br />
<br />
GAR. Come. This swampy air doth chill your blood : <br />
<br />
YIL. (turning, sees the RUFFIANS and draws). Ah, see, <br />
Garidel ! through the darkness I discover <br />
Some human figures lurking. <br />
<br />
GAR. Ah! doubtless <br />
<br />
They are black, runaways ! Give me your sword, <br />
For I am young and strong ; take these instead. <br />
(They exchange arms. YILLERE gives GARIDEL his sword, who <br />
returns a brace of pistols. The RUFFIANS rush on YILLERE, who <br />
attempts to fire, but the pistols snap. The RUFFIANS seize him.) <br />
<br />
YIL. Treachery ! Wretches ! slaves ! unhand me ! <br />
(The curtain falls.) <br />

ACT III. <br />
SCENE 1. The interior of LAFRENIERE'S tent. <br />
<br />
[Enter LAFRENIERE.] <br />
<br />
LAF. I like the plan ; it will, I think, secure <br />
A glorious victory. On one side <br />

<br />
The deep, broad, rapid Mississippi rolls ; <br />
<br />
And, on the other, impenetrable swamps <br />
<br />
Prevent approaches of the foe. Our front <br />
<br />
Protected by a breastwork and a fosse, <br />
<br />
We can defy the well-drilled troops of Spain, <br />
<br />
Bring all our force to bear, and though unused <br />
<br />
To battle (yet, in savage forests trained <br />
<br />
To use, with fatal aim, the carabine), <br />
<br />
Americana' s brave and hardy sons <br />
<br />
Will strew the field with dead, make the Spaniard <br />
<br />
Shrink away with dread, and victory insure. <br />
<br />
Yes, I like the plan ; it answers well ; <br />
<br />
It is the only one by which the rising <br />
<br />
City of my birth, Louisiana's pride, <br />
<br />
Can be defended 'gainst invading hordes <br />
<br />
Who seek for rapine and for slaughter. <br />
<br />
{Enter AUBBY.] <br />
<br />
Aubry ! What wouldst coward, traitor, here ? <br />
Hast thou repented hast thou brave become, <br />
And wouldst thou aid thy country in the fight ? <br />
Or dost thou come, a cunning spy, to watch <br />
Our movements, and give the Spaniards notice ? <br />
<br />
AUB. Lafreniere, I am no traitor. I ne'er <br />
Acknowledged thy authority, nor that <br />
Of those who rashly made you chief : I owe <br />
Allegiance to the Spanish king ; and I <br />
Do show obedience to the plain command <br />
Of Louis, by whose decree and gracious will <br />
I held the rule o'er this fair colony. <br />
I have protested, but in vain 'twas done, <br />
'Gainst thine and the people's usurpation <br />
Of the power which belonged to me. But since <br />
My proclamation is disdained, <br />
I ask thee chief of this rebel army <br />
<br />
LAF. (offers to strike him}. Eebel ! vile traitor, had I not pity <br />
On thy helplessness, I'd shake thy limbs apart <br />
For this insulting insolence. <br />
<br />
AUB. Nay, sir, <br />
<br />
Excuse my words ; no insult did I mean, <br />
And hope it is not taken so. The words <br />
Came of themselves upon my lip : I called <br />
Them not with wish of giving you offence ; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1768. 447 <br />
<br />
But rebels, fear I, ye will still be named, <br />
Unless victorious in the coming fight <br />
<br />
(LAFRENIERE offers to draw.) <br />
Nay, sir I beg I would not anger you <br />
There's no insult meant. <br />
<br />
LAF. Speak ! What wouldst thou ? <br />
<br />
AUB. I pray that, since I owe you no submission, <br />
Since enrolment with you is but voluntary, <br />
Since 'tis the duty of the rank I hold, <br />
Since my proclamation has been vain, <br />
That you would let me, at this hour, repair <br />
Unto the Spanish camp, and there remain, <br />
And all the rights of war partake as do <br />
The other subjects of the Iberian king. <br />
<br />
LAF. Pshaw ! Think' st thou that we do want thee 'mongst us ? <br />
Go, sir ! The service thou canst render Spain <br />
Will do us little injury. Go, sir ! <br />
And bow thy servile head unto the slave <br />
Of Europe's vilest despot. Go, sir ! <br />
We want not cowards, traitors, 'mongst us ; <br />
We'll dread thee less when in the Spanish camp. <br />
<br />
AUB. I thank you, sir I go ; but <br />
<br />
LAF. Mind thee, sir, <br />
<br />
Thou'lt run much risk to cross this camp ; for if <br />
One of the citizens discover thee, <br />
Thou'lt soon be torn into a thousand parts. <br />
<br />
AUB. I know that ; for I heard them cursing me, <br />
As I passed through them to you. I dread not <br />
Such detection ; this cloak doth hide me well. <br />
But can I pass the outposts ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Thou couldst not, <br />
<br />
Unless thou hadst the word. But that would make <br />
Thee tremble, but to hear it spoken out; <br />
'T would choke thy utterance to speak the word ; <br />
'Twas made for braves and freemen to pronounce. <br />
Without there ! citizen ! <br />
<br />
\Enter SOLDIER.] <br />

Man beyond the outposts, and leave him free. <br />

A traitor, who killeth while caressing you ; <br />
And yet how many other men are mild, <br />
Yet brave and true, who scorn a crime ! <br />
<br />
"Tis strange <br />
<br />
Some men have virtue, others vice ; and while <br />
Each beast has some peculiar character, <br />
Man cannot say that he is so or so. <br />
The tiger is bloody, false, and cowardly ; <br />
The lion is bold and generous ; but men <br />

That they not even know themselves. <br />

But Yillere <br />

I get no news of him ; what can it mean ? <br />
'Tis now a week since I have sent him hence, <br />
And yet he does not send intelligence ; <br />
No succors do arrive. Why lags he thus 2 <br />

Is he neglectful ? No ! That cannot be. <br />

MRS. YIL. Where is my husband, Lafreniere ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Thy husband ! <br />

Lady, I sent him to the settlements <br />
To gather forces for the army. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Have you got news ? Where how fares my hus- <br />

<br />
LAF. Lady, I'll not deceive you I know not. <br />
Daily I've waited for some messenger <br />
Yet none from him has arrived. I tremble <br />
Lest some accident has befallen him. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Ah ! 'Tis this I have trembled should occur. <br />
Ah ! 'Twas thy unquiet spirit led him on, <br />
And brought thy country into dangers vain. <br />
<br />
LAF. Madam, reproach me not. Do you not teach <br />
Your beauteous daughter, by your precepts wise, <br />
That honor's palm is more, in real worth, <br />
Than the gaudiest diadem which e'er was placed <br />

I met a slave of theirs. The thing works well, <br />
But slowly ; each day a change for Averse is seen. <br />
It will soon break out in all its frightfulness. <br />
<br />
GAR. I saw her use it ere I started thence <br />
Perhaps she does so even now. I felt <br />
A strange pleasure when I saw it. Aubry, <br />
Thou didst discover regions in my soul <br />
Which ere thou cam'st were yet untrodden. Thanks <br />
Be to thee for thy keen perception. I've found <br />
My element ; soon wilt thou see me swimming <br />
In a sea of blood. <br />

AUB. (arising). Garidel, adieu, <br />
This hour must I meet O'Reilly he'll not <br />
Be driven off as Don Ulloa was. <br />
To-night I lead the Spanish troops around ; <br />
And to-morrow shall Lafreniere's blood <br />
Stream out with bubbling force, and I shall laugh <br />
To see it flow. <br />

GAR. Adieu, good master Aubry ; <br />
I wish thee much success. I'll be with you <br />
If my duty here is done in good time. <br />
I've yet to hang old father Villere ; <br />

I think he'll not take long to die. Adieu. [Exit AUBRY. <br />

Though thou hast e'en upbraided me for all <br />

ACT IV. <br />
<br />
SCENE 1. LAFRENIERE'S Camp. LAFRENIERE'S tent in the background. <br />
The bodies of MR. and MRS. VILLERE laid out on a litter / <br />
LAFRENIERE gazing upon them. <br />
<br />
LAF. There there is what is left of noble man <br />
And virtuous woman. There Villere lies, <br />
The wise, the brave, the generous a man <br />
Respected, loved ; he had a crowd of friends, <br />
Who shook his hands and clasped him in their arms : <br />
Now they would loathe e'en to put their finger <br />
On his dead, but stately, brow ; they'd stand round <br />
In silence, as if they feared to wake him <br />
From the marble sleep of death, and look on <br />
With eyes and faces which would seem to say, <br />
Can he be dead ? What ! can this be the man <br />
The living man we saw but yesterday ? <br />
To-day, God ! what could have done this ? <br />
By some slight gashes on his side he lieth there <br />
The senseless mockery of what he was ! <br />
And on his human faculties is placed <br />
A seal as lasting as eternity. <br />
<br />
{Enter ADELAIDE, extremely pale and emaciated / he does not see her.] <br />
Thou God ! what will I say to Adelaide ? <br />
I'd tremble 'neath the look of that poor girl, <br />
And feel, though pure, as guilty of a crime. <br />
<br />
ADE. Lafreniere ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Heavens ! What voice is that \ <br />
<br />
No, no, it cannot be thou art not Adelaide ! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
454 POETR Y DRAMA TIC. <br />
<br />
ADE. O Laf reniere ! speak not such dreadful words. <br />
I know it I am no more that beauteous <br />
Adelaide on whom ye once did fix the gaze <br />
Of love ; but though now but the ghost of what <br />
I was the tattered remnant of a robe <br />
Which once was rich and graceful oh, let not <br />
This new deformity drive away the love <br />
Which once was fostered in thy breast <br />
For me ! Oh, make me not loathe e'en myself ! <br />
Know'st thou not thine Adelaide ? Say, has she lost <br />
All semblance to herself ? <br />
<br />
LAF. My Adelaide ! (They embrace.} <br />
<br />
ADE. Laf reniere ! Ah ! well mayst thou look with wide <br />
Astonished eyes upon me. Look, look on ; <br />
But try to look with love and not disgust. <br />
Seest thou these sunken, tarnished eyes this <br />
Deadened skin which leaves the unhealthy flesh <br />
These lips, which thou didst oft compare, whene'er <br />
Amidst the bloom of spring we roved, to every <br />
Crimson flower thou didst pluck these lips, <br />
Like those now withered flowers, have faded too. <br />
<br />
LAF. Nay ; rave not so, my own dear Adelaide, <br />
'Tis only passing sickness thou'lt be well <br />
In some few days. <br />
<br />
ADE. No, no ; believe it not. <br />
<br />
I thought so too ; but I did hear them say, <br />
In whispers which they thought I did not hear, <br />
'Twas poison <br />
<br />
LAF. Poison ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Yes, a cankering <br />
<br />
Drug, well known by its fell workings on me, <br />
Which on my skin perfidious hands have put, <br />
And which will soon (oh, wilt thou love me then ?) <br />
Break out in putrid sores and leaking biles. <br />
Nay, do not seem thus horror-struck. <br />
<br />
LAF. OGod! <br />
<br />
It cannot be, my Adelaide. Who could have done <br />
So infamous a deed ? What hast thou done <br />
Who harmed that one should seek thee out and thus <br />
Deface thy cheek with his polluted hands ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Ah, was it not a wanton crime ? <br />
<br />
LAF. O man ! what can exceed thy wickedness ? <br />
That enemy of every breathing thing, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 455 <br />
<br />
The serpent of the woods, will raise his head, <br />
<br />
Hiss, and shake his rattles at the approach <br />
<br />
Of unsuspecting feet. But man, the greatest <br />
<br />
Enemy of man, rejoiceth in the blood <br />
<br />
Of innocence ; and, while wild beasts destroy <br />
<br />
To get their food, man savage man doth kill <br />
<br />
To kill, and doth amusement find to see <br />
<br />
The blood ooze out of wounds his hand has made. <br />
<br />
And laughs when victims writhe in death's last agony. <br />
<br />
ADB. Ah, Laf reniere, say dost thou love me still ? <br />
<br />
LAF. If I do love thee, Adelaide ? Ask me <br />
If this warm heart still beats ; for till its throbs <br />
Do cease, its highest bound will be for thee. <br />
<br />
ADE. We parted last in anger. 'Twas silly ; <br />
But thou wilt not chide me, Lafreniere, <br />
Though 'twas a jealous whim, for sorrow now <br />
Inflicts the punishment upon me. Think, <br />
I blush to tell thee, some rival enemy <br />
Of thine he cannot be thy rival now, <br />
For thy love hangs not on the flesh as doth <br />
The love of common men yes, that rival <br />
Wrote me this, and I believed it ah, wilt <br />
Thou love me less ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Astonishment ! Yes, yes, <br />
<br />
'Tis Aubry's secret hand with which he wrote <br />
That false perfidious note he once addressed <br />
To Don Ulloa, full of monstrous lies <br />
Against his countrymen. Aubry ! Aubry ! <br />
Thy deeds will soon encounter punishment. <br />
Thou God, turn on him his own faithless arms ; <br />
Bring on him, though not from Lafreniere' s hands, <br />
The lying snares he knows so well to lay <br />
The poisoned blades he can so well direct. <br />
<br />
ADE. (seeing the bodies, but not recognizing). Ah, what ! has <br />
<br />
the war so soon been fatal ? <br />
<br />
Perhaps some orphan o'er each body there will weep <br />
A father slain. Who are they, Lafreniere ? <br />
<br />
LAF. (aside). Thou God, what can I do to ward this blow <br />
away ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Say, were they good and virtuous ? <br />
<br />
LAF. They were indeed. <br />
<br />
ADE. O death ! why dost thou not whose arm <br />
Guides in its rapid flight the fatal ball, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
456 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
Directs the impending sabre where to strike <br />
<br />
Why dost thou not, while ruling o'er the field, <br />
<br />
Select such victims of the battle's strife <br />
<br />
As should be punished by thy bloody scythe ? <br />
<br />
Preserve the father for his anxious child, <br />
<br />
And pierce the heart whose wishes, could they kill, <br />
<br />
Would slay a husband and a widow make. <br />
<br />
Say, had they children ? I would fain console them <br />
<br />
In their pains, for I can feel how strong must be <br />
<br />
The pangs which tear a son's or daughter's soul <br />
<br />
When parted from a father's love forever. <br />
<br />
LAF. My Adelaide, look not so on that dark <br />
Display of man's frail destiny, but come, <br />
For much emotion suits not thy weak health. <br />
Within my tent thou mayest rest awhile. <br />
The travel from the town must have fatigued <br />
Thee much. <br />
<br />
ADE. True. But is my mother there ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Thy mother? <br />
<br />
ADE. Yes. What startles you so much ? <br />
<br />
Where is my mother ? I must find her straight. <br />
She went from home to seek thee, and inquire <br />
If news you had of my father's uncertain fate. <br />
She promised, when she left my filial arms, <br />
In three short hours to be back again. <br />
But what disturbs thy countenance, and shakes <br />
Thy body thus ? Some accident, I fear, <br />
Hath to my mother here occurred. <br />
<br />
LAF. No, no. <br />
<br />
'Tis the humid breath of evening which makes <br />
Me feel unwell. Come, come, let's hasten in. <br />
<br />
ADE. Nay, nay ! I came to seek my mother here. <br />
Where is my mother ? <br />
<br />
LAF. My gentle Adelaide, <br />
<br />
Why wilt thou fret so much ? What wouldst thou, girl, <br />
Should happen to thy mother here ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Cruel ! <br />
<br />
Part not a mother from her child. Oh, sir, <br />
What harm has crossed her path ? Shall I not look <br />
Again upon her features kiss her cheek ? <br />
Oh, I pray you by the love to me you've sworn, <br />
Give give me back my mother ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Adelaide, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 457 <br />
<br />
Have courage, girl. How can I tell thee all <br />
Unless thou hast a stouter heart ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Oh, yes ! <br />
<br />
I see it now ! Some fatal accident <br />
Has robbed me of her ! Oh, my mother ! <br />
Where O Laf reniere, where is my mother ? <br />
Let me embrace her even if she's dead. (She turns to the bodies ) <br />
<br />
Ha! <br />
<br />
Can it be ! those bodies ! (She runs towards them.) <br />
LAF. Adelaide ! <br />
<br />
ADE. (uncovering one of the bodies). Oh ! (Faints.) <br />
LAF. (taking her in his arms). Too tender maid, canst thou <br />
<br />
withstand this shock ? <br />
Or has it, like the fiery bolt from high, <br />
Destroyed the beating life within thy breast, <br />
And borne thy soul upon its wings to God ? <br />

Our country's lost, and, what is ten times worse, <br />
We lose our freedom, ne'er to get it back. <br />
Try ye to inspire each soldier with a firm <br />
Kesolve to die or to be free. Remember, <br />
That on our arms to-day depends the fame, <br />
The future reputation of our country ; <br />
And on this day we heroes make ourselves, <br />

Thrice did our soldiers charge, and thrice repulsed ; <br />
They strive in vain to form their broken ranks ; <br />
By myriads stopped, though myriads they have slain, <br />
'Twere vain to try to bring them on again. <br />
In small detachments scattered o'er the field, <br />
They fight surrounded by the compact lines <br />
Of mercenary troops full ten times more <br />
In numbers. God ! God ! Can I not something do <br />
To turn the current of the day ? Ah, yes ! <br />
There there I see a rallied regiment ! (Shouts.) <br />
Nay ! nay ! nay ! poor weakened eyes, they're Spanish troops. <br />

Yes, ye demons, stretch forth your glutted throats, <br />
Which gurgle with the blood to-day ye've drank. <br />

Turned to a shout of victory 'gainst God ! <br />

DREAM OF LAFKENIERE. <br />
<br />
(BETWEEN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH ACTS.) <br />
LAFRENIERE appears sleeping in a prison. <br />
<br />
The prison vanishes, and a landscape appears ; a wide river flow^s <br />
through the centre ; and on each side of it, extensive forests and <br />
uncultivated fields are seen. On one side stands a throne, on which <br />
a personification of Europe is seated, holding a sceptre, and having a <br />
lash and fetters lying at her feet. A personification of Louisiana sits <br />
weeping, chained to the throne ; plaintive music, and pantomime <br />
expressive of the distress of Louisiana, and of the despotism and <br />
cruelty of Europe. <br />
<br />
The music gradually changes to more stern and threatening tones ; <br />
the sky darkens ; clouds appear ; the thunder is heard, and the light- <br />
ning flashes. <br />
<br />
A thunderbolt strikes the throne, which crumbles to pieces, while <br />
Europe is thrown prostrate on the earth. <br />
<br />
The gloom is dispelled, the clouds disappear, the music is joyful, <br />
and Louisiana exults. <br />
<br />
Liberty appears descending from above, bearing the American flag. <br />
Above the head of Liberty seventeen stars [representing the number <br />
of States of the Union at the time Louisiana was admitted] appear <br />
arranged in a circle around the words " CONSTITUTION," " UNION." <br />
<br />
Liberty approaches and takes off the fetters of Louisiana, saying : <br />
" Arise, my child, rejoin thy sisters. Thou art free." They embrace <br />
each other, while Liberty points to the Star of Louisiana rising in the <br />
sky, and ranging itself with the others. <br />
<br />
" Hail, Columbia," breaks forth, and to that tune the fields flourish, <br />
cities rise, boats and ships ply upon the river, and busy crowds of <br />
people thicken on the landscape. <br />
<br />
The prison resumes awhile its appearance, and again disappears <br />
to give place to a dark curtain, on which suddenly appears a circle of <br />
portraits (drawn in white) representing the Kevolutionary heroes and <br />
worthies, with Washington in the centre. <br />

ACT V. <br />
<br />
SCENE 1. A Prison. LAFRENIERE fettered, and chained to a ring <br />
<br />
the wall. <br />
<br />
LAF. O Liberty, thou art not invincible ! <br />
Slaves by plunder baited have o'erthrown thee, <br />
And thus it seems, that hearts inclined to crime <br />
Do feel for crime as great enthusiasm, <br />
As souls which take their fire from the skies <br />
Do in the acting of a virtuous deed. <br />
<br />
my country ! and art thou then like me <br />
Chained, fettered, and beneath a tyrant's foot ? <br />
Ah ! was green America sought in vain <br />
<br />
By Pilgrim Fathers, flying 'cross the main <br />
<br />
To seek a refuge from oppression's rod ? <br />
<br />
Were its wide forests, where untutored men <br />
<br />
Live 'neath the shade of the tall magnolia <br />
<br />
Were its broad rivers, 'gainst whose current nought <br />
<br />
But the Indian's light canoe can ply <br />
<br />
Was its free soil, from whence civilization's foot <br />
<br />
Not yet treads down and wears the verdure off <br />
<br />
Were these unto degrading slavery doomed ? <br />
<br />
Oh, no ; it cannot be ! And still I hope. <br />
<br />
Last night, when dragged across the horrid field,. <br />
<br />
Where hundreds of my countrymen laid dead, <br />
<br />
Pierced by mercenary swords and balls, <br />
<br />
1 was thrown here, within this dungeon dark <br />
Long did I weep Louisiana's fall, <br />
<br />
Till sorrow's fount was drained all dry : <br />
<br />
Sleep came at last, and closed my heavy eyes <br />
<br />
To ope imagination's lids on worlds <br />
<br />
Unknown, and in prophetic dreams to wake <br />
<br />
Midst future days. I saw, though Death metheught <br />
<br />
Did press me down with his unbending arm, <br />
<br />
My country in a veil of darkness wrapped, <br />
<br />
Her wrists and ankles worn by clinching chains, <br />
<br />
Her back all marked with deep and bleeding stripes, <br />
<br />
And moaning 'midst her sufferings. But soon <br />
<br />
The darkness vanished, and a brilliant light <br />
<br />
Dispersed the clouds which hung around in gloom ; <br />
<br />
And forth appeared, in shining radiance, <br />
<br />
A youth whose air spoke Freedom, and whose frame <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
464 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
Was built with strength and grace ; in his right hand <br />
<br />
A palm and sword he held, and in his left <br />
<br />
A scroll on which eternal truths were written, <br />
<br />
And a floating banner, where, in beauty <br />
<br />
Elended, were the white, and blue, and red, <br />
<br />
In fulgent stars and flowing stripes disposed. <br />
<br />
He broke her bonds, and with his manly voice <br />
<br />
Exclaimed, " Go, join thy sisters ; thou art free." <br />
<br />
[Enter ADELAIDE.] <br />
<br />
Adelaide ! What miracle has oped the door <br />
Of this gloomy dungeon to let thee in ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Lafreniere, I bring thee news of freedom ! <br />
With gold what Spaniard can resist its lure ? <br />
I've gained thy jailer, and to-night thou flyest. <br />
<br />
LAF. Fly ! Lady, no ! Here will I stay, and meet <br />
My fate, whate'er it be. <br />
<br />
ADE. And that is death, <br />
<br />
If thou dost here remain. <br />
<br />
LAF. A brave man's death <br />
<br />
Is better than a coward's flight. <br />
<br />
ADE. 'Tis true. <br />
<br />
Couldst thou defend thyself, I'd rather see <br />
Thee fighting sword in hand, than aid thy flight ; <br />
But here assassination doth await thee, <br />
And, while thou sleepest, treachery will plunge <br />
His poisoned knife into thy noble heart. <br />
<br />
LAF. I care not how these Spaniards end my life ; <br />
My destiny is fixed. In freedom's cause <br />
To die, is greater, in my estimation, <br />
Than dragging out in vile obscurity <br />
An useless life. To-day it is the richest prize <br />
My country's conquerors have gained. <br />
"Well, let them have it, while 'tis worth a crime. <br />
Thy father, girl, is laid among the martyrs <br />
Who yesterday did shed their blood and die <br />
For liberty. What ! Shall / shrink away <br />
And dread the example he has set me ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Then there was hope, but now <br />
<br />
LAF. Honor and glory <br />
<br />
Yet remain to be completely gained. <br />
<br />
ADE. Nay, <br />
<br />
Lafreniere, if thou lovest me, leave these vain <br />
Aspirings. Listen. There is an aged <br />
<br />

<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 465 <br />
<br />
African, who seeing, as I passed by, <br />
<br />
The threatened dissolution of my features, <br />
<br />
Offered to give me certain antidotes <br />
<br />
For the evil which afflicts me now. <br />
<br />
Lafreniere, thou art now the only prop <br />
<br />
Round which my life's weak vine will twine itself : <br />
<br />
My father mother both have been snapped off, <br />
<br />
And if thou fallest, Adelaide falls too. <br />
<br />
LAF. God, give me strength to meet this trial hard ! <br />
<br />
ADE. I will fly with thee to some distant land ; <br />
And there, in wedded love, we'll live in peace, <br />
Blest by contentment and a quiet home. <br />
<br />
LAF. "Tis wrong to put into my hands thy fate ; <br />
Why with dilemma thus surround me ? <br />
On one side, honor, the fame I cherish, <br />
Call me to stay and die ; on the other, <br />
My love, thy happiness and threatened life, <br />
Unite to make me swerve from duty's path. <br />
Adelaide, thou art unjust ; assist me <br />
Eather to preserve my fame unspotted, <br />
And tempt me not to play a shameful part. <br />
<br />
ADE. 'Tis said the northern colonies have raised, <br />
And threaten rebellion against England. <br />
Go, join them, and for freedom fight with them. <br />
<br />
LAF. I've sworn to free my country or to die ! <br />
<br />
ADE. Dost thou refuse ? <br />
<br />
LAF. I do. <br />
<br />
(She sinks down upon a seat.} <br />
Nay, Adelaide, <br />

No, no ! I had these chains too well prepared. <br />
